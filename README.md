### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edgar, a software developer located in Brazil. I'm a Node, React and React Native stack lover because of their constant growth, active communities and all the power of these technologies when they are combined. Currently my main focus is to work with backend and deep dive into microservices and systems scalability. 

So far my main skills includes: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node,js, ReactJS, React Native, NestJS, API Rest, Jest, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Git, Docker and Kubernetes.
